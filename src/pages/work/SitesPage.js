                        I landed my first "client" in 2009, when I answered a local classifieds ad looking for 
                        someone to build a website for their small business. I launched their website in 
                        exchange for $100, and they referred another potential customer my way. Eventually,
                        I formalized my business via a sole proprietership and funded my way through 
                        post-secondary by developing WordPress sites. As my connections and experience grew, 
                        I started working with digital marketing agencies and other professionals in the space.

                            The Gutenberg editor has introduced a new world of possibilities in the realm
                            of theme design and modularization of site components. Instead of strict template
                            files and limited layout options, theme development now revolves around reusable 
                            blocks. When this is fully taken advantage of, the editor becomes an incredible 
                            page building tool.

                            While every website is unique, the basic structures are often the same. 
                            I use Node.js to write code-generating CLIs to automate the process of 
                            setting up new projects and generate registration functions for
                            custom blocks.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-4">
                            While working as a Senior Web Developer at Habit, I created "Habot", 
                            a CLI for generating custom component code. My intention with this tool 
                            was not only to automate away the time spent writing out long registration 
                            logic, but also to educate the user on the available options and settings 
                            surrounding the components that the tool was generating.
                        </p>
                        <p className="">
                            With a question/answer interface, Habot includes snippets of relevant 
                            documentation for each configuration question and always lists out 
                            all available inputs for multiple-choice questions. In this way, the 
                            developer learns the ins and outs of the block registration process 
                            without having to dig through the documentation or manually write 
                            out the code.
